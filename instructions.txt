Once **CloverOS** is running, you can navigate the environment through the following elements:

 - Username: `user`
 - Password: `pass`

If you are a new user, you can modify or add additional user credentials by editing the `users` array in the `CloverOS_OS.lua` file.

 - **Main Menu**: The main menu shows a list of available applications, such as:
 - **Clock App**: Displays the current time.
 - **Windows CMD**: Lets you interact with the terminal and input commands.
 - **File system**: Allows you to create and edit files.

Use the arrow keys to navigate the menu, and press **Enter** to launch an application.

### 6. Available Apps

The following apps are included in **CloverOS**:

- **Clock App**: A simple clock that updates in real-time and displays the current system time.

- **Music Player**: A simple game where you control a snake to collect food and avoid collisions.
- **File System**: Create and edit files for various purposes. You can save your work and access it later.

More apps can be added by placing `.lua` files in the `apps` directory, same goes for commands but in 'bin' directory and only '.lua','.exe','.dll' are accepted and NO you cant use actual exe files or .ddl files as they must contain lua code.
